# Overview

This app is a basic To-Do list. To use it, you simply type the name of your task into the text box and submit. This will add a task to your to-do list which can be removed by simply tapping the task.

This project was made with the intent of expanding my capabilities as a software engineer by learning the basics of React Native and mobile programming. I wanted to create an app that is simple while still having real-world use.
